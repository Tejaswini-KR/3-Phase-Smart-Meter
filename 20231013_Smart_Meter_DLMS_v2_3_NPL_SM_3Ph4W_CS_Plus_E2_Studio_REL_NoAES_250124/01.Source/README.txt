Software: 
DLMS v2.3 NPL SM 3Ph4W Skeleton
   - 24Mhz in general.

   - Heap memory:
         + DLMS v2.2 before, size is 0x950 and need to set R_DLMS_APPS_MALLOC_USING  (TRUE) in r_dlms_app.h
         + DLMS v2.3.2 or later, size is 0x10 and need to set R_DLMS_APPS_MALLOC_USING  (FALSE) in r_dlms_app.h
     - Use in Modem (neoway and Fibcom)
     - Use in FOTA	 
   - Modem: TCP_MODE_RAW
   - FDL
   - Drivers
	    - P41 (out), P42 (out), all out 1, this is to supply power for Optical port on Smart meter.
	   - Optical Port: UART2, 9600,8n1
		  - Opticial Power :  P33 - output 1 for Optical TXD Power, P42 - output 1 for Optical RXD Power.
	   - TPC Port: UART0 - 19200,8n1
	   - DLMS Timeout:
		 - TAU channel 0
		 - 1ms interval.timer
	   - DLMS :
		 - RTC: PUSH, Time

This package contains following libraries, please be careful when sending somewhere.

"\dlms2" folder is generated by OBIS GENERATOR 1.0.6 - Jan 10 2022 - a064777638f26a11496113eecd93391b2f0507c4.
"\Configuration Workspace for IS15959 Part 2" folder is 00.Configuration

Folders & its meaning,
- "\wrapper\"			UART Link (to CG driver) for DLMS Library to work.
- "\dlms2\library\"		DLMS Library v2.3.
- "\dlms2\library\aes\ccrl"	AES-GCM-128.
- "\dlms2\library\hash\ccrl"	MD5 and SHA1.

This work space is not included AES encryption, so this project build fail. Please contact to us to know detail.
Thank you.
